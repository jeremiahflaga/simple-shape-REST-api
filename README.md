# Simple Shape REST API


**NOTE:** My solution might look more complex than it should be because I want to show that I can do an architecture which follows Clean Architecture ideas. I can make this implementation simpler if I need to. To make it simpler, I could have used only one model being passed from the Controllers to the Services, to the Repositories.

Also, I'm not sure if my design for the shapes is correct because I do not know how this API is going to be used. The requirements statement is too short and it does not say how the API will be used by the client.




## C# REST API

if possible without using any framework the app should

### Requirements

1. return both area and perimeter (and other relevant info) of a shape 

- You are to design your own payload
- Have at least 3 shapes, but not limited to it (line included)

2.	Save or Update the shape information (database not required)
